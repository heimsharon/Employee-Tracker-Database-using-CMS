## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues running the application, try the following:

- **Database connection errors:**
  - Double-check your `.env` file values for typos or missing fields.
  - Ensure PostgreSQL is running and accessible on the specified host and port.
  - Confirm your database user has the correct permissions.
- **Missing module errors:**
  - Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed.
- **Database not seeded or missing tables:**
  - Run the schema and seed scripts again:
    ```sh
    psql -U your_db_user -f db/schema.sql
    psql -U your_db_user -f db/seed.sql
    ```
- **Permission denied or command not found:**
  - Make sure you have the necessary permissions to run scripts and access the database.
  - On Windows, ensure `psql` is in your system PATH.
- **Other issues:**
  - Check the Issues section on GitHub for similar problems or open a new issue with details.
